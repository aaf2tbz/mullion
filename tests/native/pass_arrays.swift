// how many scissors and viewports one render pass takes (src/dxmt/dxmt_context.hpp kPassRectangles). Apple documents
// no limit; the driver ends the process inside the draw that follows one set too many, in a pass that has several
// viewports: every set of viewports counts as many as it sets, and every set of scissors, even of one, as many as the
// pass has viewports. a pass of `each` viewports sets its viewports, its scissors or one scissor before every one of
// its draws: this finds the first number of sets a pass does not survive, each pass in a process of its own.
