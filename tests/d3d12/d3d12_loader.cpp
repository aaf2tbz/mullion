// contract: Direct3D 12 is two modules (Getting Started with the Agility SDK, DirectX Developer Blog): d3d12.dll,
// "now just a thin loader", and D3D12Core.dll, which it loads and which is the runtime. an application built with
// the Agility SDK exports the version and path of a D3D12Core.dll of its own (D3D12SDKVersion, D3D12SDKPath), and the
// system's is loaded in its place when that is the more recent: here always, so such an application gets its device.
// applications also ask for the module by name to see that Direct3D 12 is this kind.
// d3d12.dll's exports are its own functions, as Windows' are: some applications read an export's address from the
// export address table themselves and call it, and an entry whose address is within the export section is a
// forwarder RVA, the address of a "DLL.name" string (PE Format, Export Address Table).
