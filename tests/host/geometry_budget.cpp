// contract: an object grid fits both its group limit and the payload and mesh allocation budget. Metal Feature
// Set Tables, footnote 10: "Mesh shaders can use up to 4 GB of payload and mesh geometry per draw for devices in
// the Apple7 and Apple8 GPU families." WWDC22 10162, 8:50: "payload size can't exceed the limit of 16 kilobytes."
// and 11:54: "The total size of metal::mesh cannot exceed 16 kilobytes." each object reserves one payload and a
// mesh for each primitive and geometry instance; if that allocation fits once, at least one group must fit.
